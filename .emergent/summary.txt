The AI engineer successfully took over a partially functional PWA (H2EAUX Gestion) at 68% completion. Initial tasks involved integrating missing HTML modules into , updating the backend's  model to a comprehensive  in , and adding missing JS scripts. The engineer also debugged environmental issues like  and  key errors, and fixed a frontend  conflict. After achieving 100% functionality for the core modules, the user requested PWA finalization, leading to  and  updates, along with supervisor configuration. A critical administrator password modification feature was then implemented in both backend and frontend. Subsequently, extensive deployment tooling for OVH was developed, including comprehensive READMEs, Dockerfiles, Nginx/Systemd configurations, and automated PowerShell/Bash deployment/update scripts. Post-deployment, a critical bug with hardcoded frontend URLs was identified and fixed, along with refined OVH deployment scripts. A tangential Flask project request was also fulfilled. The current focus is on a complete GitHub repo refactor for reproducible OVH deployment and preparing a Netlify-ready build, ensuring all assets are optimized, paths are relative, and PWA features are robust for static hosting.

The user initially required the H2EAUX Gestion PWA to be 100% functional. This involved integrating missing HTML for Fiches Chantier, Documents, Calendrier, MEG Integration, and Chat Équipe modules in , and updating the  backend model for Fiches Chantier to support 40+ fields instead of a limited FicheSDB model. Subsequent requests included finalizing the PWA (service worker, manifest), adding an administrator password modification feature, and providing a comprehensive OVH deployment package with automated scripts (Bash, PowerShell), configuration files (Nginx, Systemd), and detailed documentation (README, deployment guides). After deployment issues, explicit fixes for hardcoded URLs and automated OVH correction scripts were provided. The user then requested a ready-to-use Windows PowerShell script for automated OVH deployment. The latest, ongoing requirement is a complete refactor of the GitHub repository for robust, reproducible OVH deployment via PowerShell, and a separate Netlify-ready build. This Netlify build needs a  folder,  file, correctly configured  (H2eaux Gestion, icons from logo/default), functional , relative paths, and  at the root, while preserving  for API calls.

- Supervisor: Process manager for backend/frontend services.
- Nginx: Web server, reverse proxy.
- Systemd: Linux service manager.
- PowerShell/Bash: Scripting for deployment automation.
- JWT: Authentication.
- CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

<code_architecture>
The application features a FastAPI backend and a JavaScript-based React frontend, interacting with a MongoDB database.


**File Summary & Changes:**
- : Main FastAPI application. Initially had a limited  model, updated to  with 40+ fields. An endpoint for admin password modification was added.
- : Initially lacked HTML for Fiches Chantier, Documents, Calendrier, MEG Integration, and Chat Équipe modules. These were added, along with corresponding JavaScript script imports.
- : Contained hardcoded backend URL, updated to use  and dynamically detect the URL.
- : Modified to include UI and logic for an admin to change user passwords.
- , : Updated for PWA compliance, caching strategies, and service worker registration.
- , : Created/modified to manage environment variables securely.
- , , : Created/updated with deployment instructions, troubleshooting, and project overview.
- , : New directories and files created to support automated OVH deployment, Nginx configuration, Systemd service management, and cross-platform scripting.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the Netlify-ready build for the frontend:
    - Generate a  (or ) folder containing the final, optimized static assets.
    - Include a  file ().
    - Ensure the  is fully configured with the name H2eaux Gestion and appropriate icons.
    - Verify the  is fully operational for offline caching.
    - Ensure all asset paths are relative.
    - Confirm  is at the root of the generated  folder.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with preparing the H2EAUX Gestion application for seamless deployment on Netlify. This involves creating a self-contained, optimized  or  folder that can be directly linked to Netlify or drag-and-dropped. The key aspects of this task include ensuring the  is fully configured (app name H2eaux Gestion, icons from logo/defaults), the  is operational for PWA offline capabilities, and all asset paths are relative to prevent deployment issues. Additionally, an  file () needs to be included to handle routing for single-page applications. The backend API calls must continue to utilize , as the backend will be deployed separately. The engineer has just started this task by analyzing the current GitHub repository.
